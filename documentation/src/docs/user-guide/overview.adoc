== Overview
This guide assumes that you have a basic knowledge of https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin]. If you have a _Ruby_
background and are familiar with http://rspec.info/[RSpec], you won't have any problem.

=== JUnit Platform
https://jetbrains.github.io/spek[Spek] provides a *JUnit TestEngine*, which is currently the only means
of executing your specifications.


=== Supported Kotlin & Java versions
Current version is built against *Kotlin {kotlinVersion}* and requires *JDK 8* or higher
(this is the minimum version requirement for the JUnit Platform).

=== Android
Android integration tests is currently not supported and you have to use the
http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/jackandjill[Jack toolchain] to be able to built against Java 8.
