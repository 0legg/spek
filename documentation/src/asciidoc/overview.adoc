== Overview
This guide assumes that you have a basic knowledge of https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin]. If you have a _Ruby_
background and are familiar with http://rspec.info/[RSpec], you won't have any issues to get up and running.

=== What is Spek?

Tests are not only to check the code you've written executes and works, but also that it works as it should, that is, that as a developer
what's been implemented matches the requirements.

A green test doesn't tell you that the code correctly implements the specification. The user does, once they try it. However, we can try and make sure
we've correctly understood the specifications by contrasting the code with the specs. And what better place to have these specs to lookup than in the same
place we write the test code?

That's what Spek does. It is a specification framework that allows you to easily define specifications in a clear, understandable, human readable way.

You call them tests, we call them specifications.

=== Why Kotlin?

http://kotlinlang.org[Kotlin] is statically typed OSS language developed and sponsored by JetBrains. It offers many advantages over Java such as its conciseness, expressiveness
and the ability to create nice DSL. It's 100% compatible with Java which means you can call Java from Kotlin and Kotlin from Java. And it's also easy to pick up.

Spek is written in Kotlin and specifications you write will be written in Kotlin. However, your SUT (System under Test) can be Java or Kotlin. As such
you can easily use Kotlin for your specifications. Yes, you call them tests. Start calling them specifications.


=== Supported Java Versions
Current version requires JDK 8 (as a requirement for JUnit 5).

=== Android
Android integration tests is currently not supported and you have to use the
http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/jackandjill[Jack toolchain] to be able to build against Java 8.

=== IDE Support
Spek provides an https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8564[IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio plugin].

IMPORTANT: If you're using the *JUnit 4* runner, the plugin won't work as expected due to the bundled JUnit plugin taking over.
