<p>Spek is a specification framework for Kotlin, allowing you to define your specifications
in a fluent and easy to read way.</p>

<h3 id="writing-specifications">Writing specifications</h3>

<p>A specification is a class that is inherited either from <code>Spek</code>:</p>

<h3 id="runners">Runners</h3>

<p>You may write tests with Spek either for provided standalone console runner, or
as JUnit tests. JUnit tests are run under standard JUnit 4.x tests runner.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Q: What is Kotlin?</strong>
<br /><a href="http://kotlin.jetbrains.org">Kotlin</a> is an Apache 2 OSS Language targetted at the JVM and JavaScript and is developed by <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a>
It is aimed at being a concise modern language for general use. It also rocks!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is Kotlin free to use?</strong>
<br />While this is not a Kotlin FAQ, it is important to note that Kotlin is free to use and you can use the command line or the Community Edition
of IntelliJ to develop with it (which is free and OSS). Obviously IntelliJ Ultimate also works!
There’s also an Eclipse plugin in the works. Check the project site for updates.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is Spek a BDD or a TDD framework?</strong>
<br />Spek in Dutch means Bacon, so you could think of it as a Bacon Driven Development framework. Being serious for a
moment though, we (at least the original author) believe that there is a false distinction in frameworks around what TDD
or BDD is. Unit tests are ultimately about defining the specifications of your system. As such, Spek is merely a specification
framework if it can be called anything. For more information read <a href="http://hadihariri.com/2012/04/11/what-bdd-has-taught-me/">What BDD has taught me</a></p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I have more than one <em>on</em> per <em>given</em>?</strong>
<br />Yes you can. How you group your specifications is up to you</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I have more than one <em>it</em> per <em>on</em>?</strong>
<br />Yes you can. In real world applications, an action can lead to several reactions.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Isn’t it bad to have more than one assertion per test?</strong>
<br />Traditionally, in unit testing it’s been recommended that you should limit each test to one assertion with the
idea that you test a single <em>unit</em>, and at the same time, find it easy to see where a test has failed. In Spek you can still
comply with this guidance. You can have multiple <em>it</em> but you limit each to one assertion.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why is the logo a piece of bacon?</strong>
<br />We don’t have a logo, but if you want to make one, let it be Bacon. English bacon that is. Spek was originally codenamed kspec. Someone suggested to rename it to Spek which kind of fits. Turns out, Spek is Bacon in
Dutch. So why not have bacon as a logo? After all, we love bacon!</p>
